# Simple Website for Testing JavaScript Functionality

This project is a minimalist website consisting of a single HTML file, `index.html`, and a JavaScript file, `script.js`. The main purpose of this website is to demonstrate the functionality of JavaScript code.

## Project Content

- **`index.html`**: A simple HTML document with a button that tests the functionality of the code from `script.js`.
- **`script.js`**: A JavaScript file containing a function that is executed when any button is clicked.

## How to Run the Website?

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. You will see a button on the page.
3. Click the button to check if the JavaScript is working.
